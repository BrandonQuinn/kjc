Kotlin and Java compile abstraction.

So basically, I don't like either the Kotlin or Java compiler command line tools. So I wanted to created a tool that abstracts their compilation in to one tool and allows easier creation of 2 things, raw class files and a runnable jar file in a destination directory.
